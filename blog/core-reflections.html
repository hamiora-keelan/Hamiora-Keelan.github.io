    <h1 class="title">Core Reflections</h1>
    <div>
      <h1>What is core learning</h1>
      <p>
        At Dev Academy, core learning extends beyond the technical skills
        typically associated with software development. The program encompasses
        a range of essential skills, including mindfulness, mindset cultivation,
        learning strategies, and problem-solving techniques.
      </p>
      <h1>Self discovery</h1>
      <p>
        Exploring core concepts has been instrumental in my journey of
        self-discovery. I've come to realize that my problem-solving approach
        isn't as rigidly methodical as I initially believed. Through this
        process, I've uncovered my proficiency in coding and have become
        increasingly at ease with refining my foundational skills to enhance my
        capabilities. This realization has empowered me to embrace and develop
        my strengths further, fostering a deeper sense of confidence in my
        abilities.
      </p>
      <h1>Values , empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming</h1>
      <p>
        Mastering programming involves encountering numerous challenges, which
        may at times seem like towering obstacles. Thus, it's crucial to
        cultivate mindfulness. This mindfulness fosters presence, enabling one
        to recognize when it's prudent to pause and reassess. Empathy
        facilitates collaboration with others, while values provide a sturdy
        foundation for identity and purpose.
      </p>
      <h1>Core learning surprises</h1>
      <p>
        Approaching Dev Academy I expected to be learning soft skills relevant
        to the industry but I was surprised by the depth that Dev Academy has
        gone into. I really enjoyed having to write blogs, it has helped to
        consolidate the knowledge we have learnt.
      </p>
      <h1>Core learning challenges</h1>
      <p>
        It has been difficult to learn topics that I have learnt before as I
        have trouble separating the previous teaching and learning the topic
        fresh.
      </p>
      <h1>Core learnings, the key to dev academy success</h1>
      <p>
        I think the reason Dev Academy has placed an emphasis on core learnings
        is their solution to getting students into dev positions and this is
        reflected in their high success rate. Dev academy believes that tech
        employers are looking for exceptional human beings, not just another
        expert coder.
      </p>
      <h1>Is core learning time well spent</h1>
      <p>
        Core learnings have been integral to my development, and I believe I
        have much to offer as a human being. I don't aspire to be a genius
        programmer, but I intend to leverage my exceptional communication skills
        to add value to any future employers
