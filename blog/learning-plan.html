  <h2>Strengths and limitations</h2> 
  <p>
    What has supported me in overcoming numerous challenges is my capacity to maintain focus in high-pressure situations. I adapt to changing scenarios quickly. I am comfortable navigating  team dynamics and I ease group tensions by remaining problem focused.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe my biggest limitation is my ability to articulate complex thoughts and ideas

<h2>How I will manage my workload</h2>
<p>I am dedicated to continuous learning and ensuring that the educational needs of my peers are met. To adhere to time constraints, I utilize my phone timer, striving to align with suggested timeboxes.</p>
<p>While I occasionally extend beyond the allocated time during more technical tasks, I always do so within reasonable limits, avoiding unsustainable overtime.</p>
<p>I will use empathy to provide honest feedback. I will remain open to feedback given by my peers and facilitators.</p>
<p>If I feel overwhelmed I will make sure to seek help from my facilitators.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Seeking help</h2>
  <p>I expect to be able to reach out to facilitators when facing a wall in my studies and I plan to read out to them if I am falling behind with my studies.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Scheduling</h2>
<p>In my present work environment, I enjoy the flexibility to organize my day as I see fit. However, I anticipate that this arrangement may not persist throughout the entire course duration.</p>
<p>Should there be any changes, I am committed to maintaining open communication with the facilitators and keeping them informed.</p>
