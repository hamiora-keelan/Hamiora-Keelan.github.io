        <h2>What is Neuroplasticity?</h2>
        <p>
          Neurons create a complex neural network throughout the body's nervous
          system, allowing cells to form connections and communicate with each
          other, these connections are called synapses. Neuroplasticity refers
          to the ability of synapses to form new connections and grow stronger
          through experiences such as learning and practicing skills.
          Neuroplasticity also plays a big part in memory and retention through
          the forming of new connections, try this activity taken from Kevin
          Horsley's instantly recalling activity Ted Talk and skip to 8:05 to
          watch your brain form new connections real time.

        <h2>The benefits of understanding neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding and believing in the principles of neuroplasticity is
          beneficial as it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Positions you to readily accept a growth mindset through
            understanding your capabilities are not determined at birth and you
            are in control of your learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            It allows you to tailor your learning journey and learn new
            techniques that will optimise your learning.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          Actions I can take to benefit from the principles of neuroplasticity
        </h2>
        <p>
          Whilst understanding neuroplasticity primes you for learning, there
          are further steps you can take to create new connections and
          strengthen exisiting connections.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pick up a creative hobby: creativity forces the brain to think in
            new ways through exploring different perspectives. This creates
            flexibility in your neural network, and strengthens your ability to
            form connections between previously unrelated subjects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learning a new skill: Learning new skills enhances neuroplasticity
            by forming fresh neural connections and reinforcing existing ones.
            It engages diverse brain regions, fostering synaptic strength and
            adaptability. Through practice, challenges, and problem-solving, it
            promotes resilience and cognitive flexibility. This lifelong
            learning sustains mental agility, reducing the risk of cognitive
            decline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Engaging your senses: When you actively use your senses—sight,
            hearing, touch, taste, and smell—you activate corresponding brain
            regions, encouraging the formation of new connections and
            reinforcing existing ones. This multisensory input enhances synaptic
            plasticity, the brain's ability to adapt and reorganize in response
            to sensory experiences. Additionally, sensory engagement promotes
            cross-modal integration, where information from different senses is
            combined, leading to more robust and interconnected neural networks.
            As a result, actively engaging your senses through experiences like
            exploring new environments, trying new foods, or learning through
            hands-on activities can significantly enhance neuroplasticity,
            fostering a more adaptable and resilient brain.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness practices enhance neuroplasticity
            by reshaping brain structure and function. They increase gray matter
            density in areas related to attention and self-awareness, strengthen
            connectivity between brain regions, and reduce amygdala activity,
            fostering emotional resilience. Mindfulness also affects
            neurotransmitter function, promoting relaxation and reducing
            anxiety. Additionally, it may stimulate neurogenesis, supporting the
            birth of new neurons. Overall, mindfulness fosters adaptive changes
            in the brain, promoting mental well-being and cognitive flexibility.

      <div>
        <h2>What does having a growth mindset mean?</h2>
        <p>
          My understanding of a growth mindset is to embrace challenges and
          persevere through obstacles, understanding that talents can also be
          developed through effort and hard work. This applies to both those who
          believe they are untalented and those who are talented; as long as you
          believe there is a ceiling to your growth, your progress will remain
          hindered at some point.

        <h2>What was unexpected during this activity?</h2>
        <p>
          When I originally began researching the growth mindset, I felt so
          strongly that I had a growth mindset and I may be wasting time
          learning it again. However, I quickly realised I was stuck in a
          paradox; that I was limiting my growth assuming I had no room to grow
          my growth mindset.

          Actions I can take to integrate a growth mindset into my learning
          journey
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Embrace feedback: Many individuals offer feedback with positive
            intentions, aiming to support your growth. Being receptive to input
            from colleagues, friends, family, and managers can facilitate
            personal development. However, it's important to maintain a critical
            mindset, as not all feedback may be transparent or constructive;
            some might necessitate additional interpretation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness allows individuals to recognize
            when they are operating from a fixed mindset—the belief that
            abilities are innate and unchangeable. By identifying these
            triggers, individuals can consciously shift towards a growth
            mindset—the belief that abilities can be developed through
            dedication and effort.

        <h2>Adjustments to learning plan</h2>
        <p>
          I believe I can adjust my learning plan to have a growth mindset at
          its core, by spending more time engaging my sense in different
          environments. I think spending more time out doors will help me in
          creating and strengthening new neural pathways. I will also include in
          my mindfulness activities that help identify fixed mindset triggers
          and consciously replace them with growth mindset behaviours.
