      <h1 class="section-title">Blocked on a problem</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>What problem were you stuck on?</h2>
        <p>
          am blocked right now as I am writing this particular section of my
          blog, and I am unsure of which problem to pick on.
        </p>
        <h1>How did you solve it?</h1>
        <p>
          In this particular example, I started working backwards to build an
          understanding of the context and hopefully begin putting the puzzle
          pieces together. In doing so, I realised that in the list of
          problem-solving methods, one of my commonly used methods in my arsenal
          - the working backwards method. Whilst not applicable to every
          scenario, I think working backwards is powerful tool for solving
          problems from different angles.
        </p>
        <h1></h1>
        <p>
          honestly like a rollercoaster, I get frustrated when I hit a wall, I
          feel great when I think the solution is going through the wall only to
          hit my head, to feeling great again when I discovered there's a door,
          followed by immediate facepalming.
        </p>
        <h1>what did you learn?</h1>
        <p>
          I learnt that not all problem-solving scenarios can be solved using
          the same techniques and it's a good idea to have multiple skills under
          your belt to ensure you have a comprehensive arsenal to tackle
          problems. I also learnt that problem-solving, like all skills can be
          learnt and strengthened.

      <h1 class="section-title">Elegantly solved a problem.</h1>
      <div>
        <h1>what was the problem?</h1>
        <p>
          The problem was understanding the logic behind a piece of code
          involving if conditions and the modulo operator (%) when trying to
          solve the FizzBuzz problem.
        </p>
        <h1>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h1>
        <p>
          I first broke the problem down in my head, similar to how you would
          write pseudocode. This led me to the understanding that an
          <code>if</code> statement would be used. I then researched using LLM's
          and google search which led me to understanding how the modulo
          operator works. I then needed to figure out how the modulo operator
          would work with the <code> if </code> statement which required trial
          and error whilst using the error codes from the test.js files.
        </p>
        <h1>how did you feel throughout the process?</h1>
        <p>
          I felt like I was in a state of flow the entire time, it felt
          seamless, enjoyable and elegant.
        </p>
        <h1>what did you learn?</h1>
        <p>
          I learnt that having a methodical approach to problem-solving can have
          a deep impact on the elegance of its timely completion.

      <h1 calss="section-title">
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes
      </h1>
      <div>
        <h1>How do you feel about Pseudocode</h1>
        <p>
          I am still not fully confident in using Pseudocode as it is not my
          usual go to problem solving process, however, I do see the value in it
          as Pseudocode allows developers the ability to break a problem down
          into smaller tasks and to envision the desired output.
        </p>
        <h1>How do you feel about Trying something</h1>
        <p>
          This is my go to method, as it incites my creativity. I love getting
          hands on, trying something out, failing, and trying again.
        </p>
        <h1>How do you feel about Rubber ducky method</h1>
        <p>
          I am still uncomfortable talking to my self, especially when others
          are around.
        </p>
        <h1>How do you feel about Reading error messages</h1>
        <p>
          These are a god send for my usual hands on trial and error approach to
          problem solving. As it gives me a general guideline and gives live
          feedback on my attempts.
        </p>
        <h1>How do you feel about Console.logging?</h1>
        <p>
          I find console logging just as I find error messagesâ€¦ useful. console
          logging gives me live feedback on my code.
        </p>
        <h1>Googling</h1>
        <p>
          As a gen z, Google is second nature and the tips from Dev Academy have
          provided me with a better strategy for crafting prompt for searches.
        </p>
        <h1>Asking your peers for help</h1>
        <p>
          I love reaching out to peers as they provide a great backboard to
          bounce ideas off.
        </p>
        <h1>Asking coaches for help</h1>
        <p>
          Definitely my weakest problem-solving technique as I love to solve
          problems my self regardless of the time spent on it. I do however, see
          how this is detrimental in the long run especially working with
          deadlines.
        </p>
        <h1>Improving your process with reflection</h1>
        <p>
          I am super comfortable with reflection and I like to take 5 minutes
          after completing a difficult problem by sitting on my couch with
          nothing but my head reflection through the problem.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>
          Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h1>
        <p>
          I am not so much reluctant to ask for help, more so, it doesn't cross
          my mind. I will seek to include this thought in my most problem
          reflections with the goal to be mindful of when I need help.
