    <h1 class="title">Emotional Intelliigence: Why it's so important</h1>
    <div>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional intelligence, the ability to navigate both our own emotions
        and those of others, is crucial. Every day, we encounter over 400
        emotional stimulus that significantly influence our behaviour.
        Developing emotional intelligence and mindfulness empowers us to manage
        these emotions and actions, not just for ourselves, but also for those
        around us.

      <h3>EQ vs IQ vs personality</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EQ), Intelligence Quotient (IQ), and personality
        are distinct aspects of human capabilities, each contributing to an
        individual's overall makeup. IQ represents cognitive abilities,
        encompassing reasoning, problem-solving, and logical thinking. It is
        often measured through standardized tests and is considered an indicator
        of intellectual prowess. On the other hand, EQ revolves around emotional
        awareness, empathy, and interpersonal skills. It reflects one's ability
        to recognize, understand, and manage emotions in oneself and others.
        While IQ is associated with cognitive prowess, EQ emphasizes the social
        and emotional dimensions of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personality, in contrast, encompasses enduring patterns of thoughts,
        behaviors, and emotions that shape an individual's responses to various
        situations. It is not strictly measured like IQ or EQ but is often
        assessed through personality tests. Personality traits, such as
        extroversion, conscientiousness, openness, agreeableness, and
        neuroticism (the Big Five), provide insights into how individuals
        typically approach life and interact with others. While EQ focuses on
        emotional acumen, IQ on cognitive abilities, personality delves into the
        stable and consistent behavioral tendencies that define an individual's
        uniqueness. In essence, these three dimensions—EQ, IQ, and
        personality—contribute in tandem to the rich tapestry of human
        complexity.

      <h3>EQ vs IQ vs Personality</h3>
      <p>
        Developing emotional intelligence involves cultivating two primary
        competencies, each encompassing both internal and external dimensions.
      </p>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li><h4>Personal competencies:</h4></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Internal aspect: Cultivating self-awareness is crucial; it
              involves recognizing and understanding your own emotions and
              feelings. A heightened self-awareness enables you to anticipate
              your emotional responses to stimuli, even those that may occur in
              the distant future.
            </li>
            <li>
              External aspect: Self-management is the practical application of
              self-awareness. Combining a deep understanding of your emotions
              with effective self-management empowers you to regulate your
              behaviors in response to incoming emotional stimuli.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li><h4>Social competencies:</h4></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Internal aspect: Nurturing social awareness is essential for
              understanding the emotions of those around you. This skill
              develops through active listening and attentiveness to both
              auditory and visual cues from others. A heightened social
              awareness provides you with the ability to anticipate the emotions
              of those in your social sphere.
            </li>
            <li>
              External aspect: Relationship management involves applying
              emotional intelligence to navigate and influence the emotions of
              those around you. It goes beyond understanding emotions to
              actively shaping and fostering positive connections with others.
              Effective relationship management is the outward expression of
              emotional intelligence in social contexts.

      <h3>Mindfulness</h3>
      <p>
        A challenge I face when delving into literature on thought processes,
        behavior, and emotional intelligence is maintaining authenticity in my
        own actions and thoughts. I've observed instances in leaders whose honed
        leadership skills sometimes lead to a loss of genuineness in their
        behaviors. Better a diamond with a flaw than a perfect pebble.

        This is not a rejection of growth; instead, it underscores the
        importance of remaining mindful during the growth process. It involves
        the ability to discern what makes you unique and what aspects may
        require change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Picture yourself as a gardener caring for a flower. Mindfulness becomes
        the key to observing the flower, understanding its needs, and
        pinpointing areas for growth. With this awareness, you can choose how to
        nurture the flower, ensuring its flourishing while preserving its
        inherent beauty and distinctive characteristics.
