        Without positioning, you might as well be living your life in 2d.
        Mastering the positioning properties will give you the freedom to move

        applies to HTML and CSS. The default property for CSS positioning is
        Static. The Static property positions elements in the same order that
        they were written in HTML. However, if you don't change the positioning
        property from static to one of the methods discussed in this article the
        following properties will not change the position of the content:
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
