          Without positioning, you might as well be living your life in 2d.
          Mastering the positioning properties will give you the freedom to move
          content to your will. Most programs have a default setting, this also
          applies to HTML and CSS. The default property for CSS positioning is
          Static. The Static property positions elements in the same order that
          they were written in HTML. However, if you don't change the
          positioning property from static to one of the methods discussed in
          this article the following properties will not change the position of
          the content:
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
