      <h4>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now?

        During my climb to restaurant manager, had made a good friends with a
        front of house manager, they grew to be a great mentor for me. During my
        first year as the manager for the restaurant I came across a difficult
        situation. Unfortunately this friend had broken a zero tolerance food
        safety policy on multiple occasions and I had no choice but to terminate
        them. I had taken into consideration their relationship with me, along
        with the strength of their skills in coaching and despite their value to
        the business and to me, I had to follow through with the termination.

      <h4>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity?
      </h4>

        The biggest influence in my life have been my family, in particular, my
        sister. She was the first person in my family of 8 to go to university.
        She has always been an inspiration to me through her achievements. She
        has indirectly taught me what hard work looks like, that perseverance
        will help you achieve your goals and that compassion can still be a
        priority despite success.

      <h4>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey?
      </h4>
      <p>
        After completing the BFI test I believe my open mind will have the
        biggest positive impact on my learning journey. It will help me stay
        unbiased and curious.

      <h4>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I think the biggest limitation for me is the fear of my mac breaking
        halfway through the course.

      <h4>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why?

        During a communication group project, we divided roles among six team
        members. Unfortunately, one of our teammates struggled to meet the set
        deadlines, affecting the overall progress. Reflecting on this
        experience, I believe that for my next team project, establishing clear
        expectations from the beginning and actively listening to the
        limitations of each team member would enhance our understanding and
        enable us to support one another more effectively.
